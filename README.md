# AlphaFold

Proteins, essential molecular machines, perform important bodily functions including contracting muscles, digesting food, and healing wounds. They also provide structural support by reinforcing the shape of cells and tissues. In oncology, they are key players in cancer mechanisms and treatment targets. Understanding their structures is essential to investigating their functions. However, only about 100,000 unique protein structures have been determined, a minute fraction of the billions of known protein sequences.

To address this gap, humans have turned to artificial intelligence (AI). AI systems mimic complex human thought processes, performing advanced functions, independently or with human input. Despite AI advancements, there remains a shortage of accurate computational approaches for large-scale structural bioinformatics. 

AlphaFold, an AI program developed by DeepMind, uses deep learning systems based on neural networks and representation learning. This enables the system to improve over time, or in a more basic sense “learn while on the job”. Initially released in 2018,  AlphaFold analyzes DNA sequence databases to identify changes and correlations of organisms, without known 3D structures. The latest 2024 version represents a major milestone in structural biology, with improved accuracy of predicting structures of protein complexes with DNA, RNA, post-translational modifications, ligands, and ions.

AlphaFold aids oncology by quickly mapping altered proteins in cancer cells. A 2023 study published in Chemical Science introduced Pharma.AI, an AI-powered drug discovery platform combining PandaOmics and Chemistry42. This platform identified a new drug target for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common primary liver cancer. Using AlphaFold's predicted protein structure, they generated and tested molecules, discovering a small molecule compound for cyclin-dependent kinase 20 (CDK20) in just one month, significantly faster than traditional drug discovery methods. 

In conclusion, structural-based drug discovery, a mainstay method for identifying hit molecules and performing lead optimization is bolstered by AlphaFold, which has revolutionized structural biology by bridging the gap between the many known protein sequences and the few with established structures.   With its ability to accurately predict protein shapes, AlphaFold accelerates progress in oncology, aiding in the discovery of new drug targets and treatments.
